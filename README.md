# Marcos Landi Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This project showcases my portfolio, blog, and other content that represents my work and interests. Built using [Astro](https://astro.build), this site is designed to be fast, modern, and easy to maintain.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project is intended to be organized as follows:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ [posts].astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets like images and icons.
